working on calling back from C to java when we get the notifications... current idea was to have the C side store the VM and class and method info needed as soon as it's loaded (if possible), and also then do an immediate callback with the initial state (so callback-making fn would have to handle both already-attached and not-attached cases)... to keep things simple, all the java callback stuff would be pure C.
